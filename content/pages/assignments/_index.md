Short Papers
------------

Three short writing assignments early in the term will require students to engage in close reading and critical analysis of key ancient literary sources. Students must complete three of the four options for the short papers.

[Short Paper Option 1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignments-short-paper-1)

[Short Paper Option 2]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignments-short-paper-2)

[Short Paper Option 3]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignments-short-paper-3)

[Short Paper Option 4]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignments-short-paper-4)

All papers must comply with the following presentational guidelines:

*   Papers must be 750 words in length (≈3 pages).
*   Papers must be typed in 12-point font, with at least 1½ line spacing.
*   Your paper should have a brief title; but there is no need for a title page.
*   On the short response papers, a bibliography is also unnecessary.

The papers will be worth 30% of the final grade.

Research Paper
--------------

The final paper should be a research paper of 3,000 words (≈10 to 12 pages) on a theme of your choice. Your research paper will be expected to demonstrate the skills developed in your earlier writing assignments (i.e. close analysis of ancient literary and non-literary evidence) **as well as** knowledge and understanding of as wide as possible a range of the modern works relevant to your chosen theme.

A [topic proposal and outline]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/assignments-topic-proposal-and-outline) will be due during Session 17.

The research paper will be worth 40% of the final grade.
